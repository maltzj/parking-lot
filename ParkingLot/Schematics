Let S = Chronos + Traffic Generator

SETUP
1) S starts up (doesn't send cars)
2) Manager Starts
3) Simulation connects to manager
4) Gates start
5) Gates connect to parking lot
6) Gates connect to manager
7) Gates connect to each other
8) Gates connect to simulation
9) Simulation starts sending cars

LOOP
1) S updates time
2) S ---time---> Parking Lot
3) Parking Lot ---done---> S (So we can have cars leave before we admit new ones)
4a) S ---car---> Gate
4b) S ---time---> Gates
5) G ---trade tokens---> G
6) Gates ---cars---> Parking Lot
7) Gates ---done---> S
REPEAT
