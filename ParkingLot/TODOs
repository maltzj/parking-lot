TODOS:

Implement a parking lot that the gates send their car to. 
	 In the "check if car leaves" method in the traffic generator message the parking lot
Hook up the gates to the simulator
	We can do this one of two ways.  
	One: we can let the gates listen on two ports (one for other gates and one for the simulator) and have the simulator connect to the gates
	Two: We can assume that the simulation will only be connected to and the gates will always be doing the connecting.  If that's the case then we will need to figure out what to do with the manager (probably have gates connect to the manager and the manager to the simulation)
Create a start-up logic in general (what order stuff gets started)
	Add main methods to start stuff up

Create a manager class


TEST!!!!

There is a design flaw currently in the code that I just realized.
Basically the TokenTrader object for each gate is responsible for accepting connections.
This is a flaw because it assumes that only gates will want to connect to other gates.
We should probably change this so that the accepting of connections is handled within
the Gate itself and then delegated as is necessary.  I don't think it will be a huge issue
for now, but it is worth noting.
