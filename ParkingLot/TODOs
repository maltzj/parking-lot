TODOS:

Implement a parking lot that the gates send their car to. 
	 In the "check if car leaves" method in the traffic generator message the parking lot
Give gates a method to listen on a given port
	Hook up the gates to the simulator.
Add main methods to start stuff up

TEST!!!!

There is a design flaw currently in the code that I just realized.  Basically the TokenTrader object for each gate is responsible for accepting connections.  This is a flaw because it assumes that only gates will want to connect to other gates.
We should probably change this so that the accepting of connections is handled within the Gate itself and then delegated as is necessary.  I don't think it will be a huge issue for now, but it is worth noting.
